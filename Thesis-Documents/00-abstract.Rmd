Existing variable importance measures for random forests are often unreliable when there are correlated predictors in the data set. In this paper, we develop and test whether added variable plot importance (AVPI) and joint added variable plot importance (JAVPI) measures are capable of handling correlated predictors in the dataset when assessing whether a predictor is informative towards the response. Simulation results indicate that while the AVPI measures are in certain cases more informative than existing variable importance measures when there are correlated predictors, AVPI is generally noisier than existing variable importance measures.  We also find that the JAVPI measure is generally able to account for correlated predictors in the data, and does not suffer from the same issues of noise as the AVPI measure. \par

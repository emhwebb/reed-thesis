### Research Log

This week I continued with my Lit Review, reading through sections of
Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) and Computer Age Statistics
(CASI) pertaining to random forests, and beginning to read Richard
Berk's treatment for Random Forests in Statistical Learning from a
Regression Perspective (SLRP). All three sources were similar, yet of
course different in their treatment of forests with ESL and CASI
focusing on Regression settings and SLRp focusing on the Classification
setting. In addition, I found several papers that seem of interest as a
result of reading these three bookss. Some thoughts:

1.  I should look at Breiman's 2001 paper on Random Forests some
    point soon. There could be good stuff there.

2.  The case of subsampling instead of bootstrap and distinctions
    between the two was unclear, but it seems that I should look into
    subsampling schemes at least a little bit.

3.  It's important to look at Wager's work. He seems to have developed
    many of the theoretical tools (along with others) these past few
    years to understand the theory behind Random Forests.

4.  What makes the CART scheme different from those discussed in
    theoretical papers?

5.  What about using the L1-norm instead of L2-norm? Does the give
    better behavior? This is something Berk pointed out (and I think he
    referenced someone elses paper), but this could be interesting to
    try to implement.

6.  Can some of the theoretical tools being developed be used to analyze
    variable importance, and uses of variable importance for inferential
    aspects of Random Forests?

In addition I started to play around with RF's (Random Forests) in R
using the randomForest package. I found the rfPermute package by Eric
Archer, and I think I'm going to look into fitting RF's to
classification data using rfPermute and randomForest.
